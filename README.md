# Ansible role for installing docker on a host
Features:
- installs latest docker-ce
- installs docker python module
- installs docker-compose
- (optional) configures docker with ipv6 support
- (optional) performs a docker system prune

# Requirements
Provisioning host:
- ansible 2.9 or later

Host that will run docker
- Ubuntu 18.04 or later (or Debian-based Linux distro running apt)

# How to use this role

Add this role to your Ansible playbook file.
```yaml
- name: docker role
  role: elgeeko1-docker-ansible
```

## Optional variables

- `docker_prune`: prune docker containers, images and networks. Defaults to `true`

To enable IPv6 support, add the following variables:
- `docker_ipv6_enabled: true`: enable IPv6
- `docker_ipv6_cidr: "fd00::/80"`: set the IP address allocation and netmask for the IPv6 docker network. Replace the default value with the subnet appropriate for your network.


# How to install this role
### Method 1: Install using ansible-galaxy

The most robust way to install this role is to use ansible-galaxy,
which is installed with ansible by default. ansible-galaxy is effectively a package manager for ansible. It installs roles
from the community, or from private git repos, into your local machine for use in your playbooks.

Start by adding this role to an ansible-galaxy dependency file. Typically this file lives alongside your playbook file and by convention is named `requirements.yml`.

Add the following section to `requirements.yml`:

```
roles:
  - name: elgeeko1-docker-ansible
    src: https://github.com/elgeeko1/elgeeko1-docker-ansible
    version: main
```

If there is already a `roles` section, simply append this role to
add it as a dependency.

Then, install the role using ansible-galaxy:

`ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml -v`

### Method 2: Clone this repository into a `roles` directory

Use this method if you plan to modify this role, or if for some
reason the ansible-galaxy method fails.

Starting from your playbook directory, change into the `roles`
directory and clone:

```
$ ls
 > playbook.yml
 > roles/
$ cd roles/
roles$ git clone https://github.com/elgeeko1/elgeeko1-docker-ansible
```
